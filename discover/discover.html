                    <p>
                        Get up close to Mount Mayon and its surroundings by going to the Mayon Volcano Natural Park.
                        This park is over 5,800 hectares, located between 3 cities in Albay.

                        Not only is it home to the best views in the province, but it also houses over 150 floral
                        and 83
                        tree species. Aside from this, the park is also full of rivers, creeks, and rice fields that
                        you
                        can trek on by foot or through an ATV.

                        So even if you can see Mayon Volcano anywhere in Albay, there’s nothing better than getting
                        up
                        close to it!

                        1724
                        and destroyed by the 1814 eruption of the Mayon Volcano. They are located in Barangay Busay,
                        Albay,
                        Philippines. The ruins, currently protected in a park overseen by the municipal government

                        The 1st Colonial Grill became famous due to the unique dishes they offer, especially the
                        famous Sili Ice Cream. This unique dessert dish garnered some awards and was featured quite
                        a number of times already in magazines, TV and more! Luckily, we were able to try dining in
                        this restaurant when we visited Albay for a block vacation.

                        Sumlang Lake is possibly the most pleasant tourist spot in Camalig Albay. This small lake is
                        found in
                        the
                        countryside, just a short drive from the city, and here you can sit back on a bamboo raft
                        while
                        you
                        float across the water and enjoy the magnificent views of Mount Mayon.

                        Lots of locals use the lake for fishing, and you could even try your hand at this too if you
                        fancied, or you can kick back at the restaurant on the water’s edge and try some great local
                        food.

                        Lignon Hill is located near Legazpi Airport. The hill stands at 156 meters (511 feet) tall
                        and has
                        best
                        view of Mayon Volcano and the whole Albay. It is best to go there in the morning if you want
                        to see
                        Mayon Volcano without the clouds. When it’s in the afternoon, the clouds tend to cover the
                        volcano.
                        It
                        is also good to go there during the late afternoons up to evenings so that you can see the
